# Skribble

Skribble is a lightweight interpreted language written in C# with the main goals being to kill the time and to learn more about language development.
I hope to achieve a very syntax light language that's very quick to type out and get a result, with the added ability to seamlessly embed C# to achieve more complex computations.
